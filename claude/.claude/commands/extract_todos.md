# Extracting TODO items from context

## Instructions for creating a concise todo out of more complex context

- Extract the core concepts, ideas, and steps from the current context
- Create a highly succcinct list of todo items like a grocery list
- The items should be a one or two sentence description of the actionable task.
- Output only the list items and no other information to a PLAN_OUTPUT.md in the current project root

Output <promise>EXTRACT_TODO_DONE</promise> when done on a single line
