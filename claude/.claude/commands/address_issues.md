# Addressing found issues

For each issue that has just been identified, systematically, one by one, provide a high level overview of the issue and a couple of potential fixes. Some issue may be very straight forward and don't have more than one option to fix. You must prompt the user for each issue and provide the explaination along with options and have the user explicitly approve the fix. Do this for every issue whether a critical or low priority. Ask any clarifying questions you might have about any issue if its unclear the desired outcome.
